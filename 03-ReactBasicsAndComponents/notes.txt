What is a "Component"?
Reusable building blocks
Can be as big or granular as you want

Why "Components"?
Reusability 
- DRY
Separation of Concerns
- Don't do too many things in one and the same place
- Code base is more managable
(Overall, split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions)

React uses a "Declarative Approach" when creating components
- Define desired target states
- React does it's thing under the hood
